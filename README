 Password Generator Program v1.1

 Purpose: The program takes 2 base passwords and combines them with the
   website they are to be used for to make a single, secure password
   for each site. All the user has to remember is their passwords,
   meaning the password they actually type into the website will be
   more complex and difficult to crack than one they had to memorize.
   It also eliminates shared passwords between sites, so someone who
   finds out your Reddit password can't simply use it to access your
   email.

   Both 9- and 12-digit passwords can be created, at the user's 
   discretion, to account for different websites' eccentricities.

   One weakness this method has is that all passwords are hex values,
   meaning that they consist of characters from 0-9 and a-f, A-F. Thus,
   there are fewer possible combinations than a completely alphanumeric
   password. Fortunately, an attacker would have to know that the letters
   g-z and G-Z are not in use to gain an advantage.
   Anyone improving upon this program would do well to change the method
   of password generation to work around this weakness.
